To fix:
    Fix memory JavaScript as it doesn't save the added comments but only
    the last comment made
    
    Add div for a text box for the comment, parts that I liked
    Change Fonts
    Add animations and transitions when opening the pages

To add to the site:
    Search bar with Order button alphabetically, last readed, Pages
    A div to enter new books and delete
    Order the divs if there are many
    A way to add the number of pages already read possibly to count how many left
    Add more images to each page (max - 5)
    Find a way to use JavaScript

Last but not least: 
    Find a way to share to phone

To be added later on the project after finishing all the pages:
    Links for each of the characters with an image of the person, description, age, character, personal comment
    About button close to the home button to give general information about the page
    A database or save option automatically locally
    A way to bookmark favourite books
